# Johan Lind (Mormert) :boom:
I like game & engine development, real time rendering and a bunch of other fun stuff! :octocat:

## C++ Cross-Platform 3D Game Engine Project

The engine [_jle_](https://github.com/mormert/jle) powers one of my unannounced games, but the engine itself is made open source. <br>
